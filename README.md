# 🧮 Calculator Program using C

## 📖 Project Description
This project is a Menu Driven Scientific Calculator developed using the C programming language.
The calculator allows users to perform both basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) and scientific calculations such as square, square root, power, trigonometric functions (sine, cosine, tangent), and logarithm.

The program is menu driven, meaning the user selects the desired operation from a list of options. It is simple, user-friendly, and suitable for beginners who want to understand the fundamentals of programming logic, loops, and conditional statements.
