# 🧮 Calculator Program using C

## 📖 Project Description
This project implements a **simple calculator** using the C programming language.  
It allows the user to perform basic arithmetic operations such as **addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division** by selecting an operation and entering two numbers.

The project demonstrates the use of **switch-case statements, user input, and arithmetic operators** in C.

## 🎯 Aim of the Project
The aim of this project is to design a calculator program that:
- Takes two numbers as input from the user  
- Allows selection of arithmetic operation  
- Performs the selected operation  
- Displays the result on the screen

## ❓ Why This Project Is Made
This project is created to:
- Understand **switch-case control structure**
- Learn how **arithmetic operations** are handled in C
- Practice **input/output operations**
- Build logic for real-life applications like calculators

---

## 🛠 Utility / Applications
- Useful for **beginners learning C programming**
- Can be used in **lab practicals and exams**
- Forms the base for **advanced scientific calculators**
- Helps in understanding **decision-making logic**

## 🔮 Future Scope
This project can be enhanced by adding:
- Scientific operations (square root, power, trigonometry)
- Continuous calculations using loops
- Graphical User Interface (GUI)
- Error handling for invalid inputs
- Floating-point precision improvements

## 🧮 Algorithm
1. Start  
2. Display menu of operations (+, -, *, /)  
3. Ask user to select an operation  
4. Take two numbers as input  
5. Use switch-case to perform selected operation  
6. Display the result  
7. Stop
